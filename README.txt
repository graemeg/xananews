XanaNews Newsreader
===================

XanaNews is a free, powerful, fully featured NNTP client (newsreader) for
Microsoft Windows. It is written in Delphi. The original creator was
Colin Wilson.

Here's what it does so far...
------------------------------
* Support for Multiple News (NNTP) Servers.

* Multiple threaded engine.  Supports three threads per news server so
  you can simultaneously download group lists, message headers and messages
  for multiple servers.

* Threaded multicolumn tree message display.  Display messages in thread
  or chronological order.  Sort threads or messages by date, size, author
  or subject.

* Displays NNTP and MIME images inline, building them up as they arrive.

* Save images and other binary attachments.

* Powerful message deleting feature.  Delete messages that don't match your
  criteria.

* Threads that contain messages to you are displayed highlighted.

* Intelligent resume/cancel button.  When it's red you can cancel the
  selected operation.  When it's green you can resume after network
  failures, and when it's grey you can't click it!

* Batch mode.  Define batches of message retrieval operations. A single
  batch can work across multiple newsgroups - even on multiple servers!

* Both images and other binary attachments can now be saved.

* Powerful configurable message filters can be created for individual
  newsgroups, or all newsgroups on a server.

* Decode UUE, Base64 and yEncoded messages.

* SSL Support

* Supports posting multiple attachments

* Integrates with ISpell spell checker.
